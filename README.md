<img src="Cover Image-Arseny-Togulev.jpg" width="950" height="500">

In this repo, I will provide a comprehensive guide on how to utilise the pipeline() function of the transformers library to create an end-to-end NLP pipeline in just one line of code. This process will contain the following steps:
1. Preprocessing the received raw text to make it model-ready
2. Use a model of your choice for inference.
3. Post-process the results to make them human-readable.

For the full guide, you can read my article on Medium:

I will highly recommend running this code in [Google Colab](https://colab.google)
